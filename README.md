# Capstone project Documentation 
Here is the presentation of my project.
This project stands to be my Capstone project after completing a long training program with DSA.

## Project Topic: Palmoria Group HR Analysis based on Gender

### Project Overview
This data analysis aims to generate insight into gender inequality, if there is one, and identify 
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues, and address them immediately with some recommendations.

### Data source 
The data source used here is Palmoria Group emp data .csv and, Palmoria Group Bonus rules.excel workbook and this is an open-source dataset that can be freely downloaded online on Kaggle or FRED

### Tools Used 
- MS Excel:
   - For data collection
   - For data cleaning
   - For the Explanatory Data Analysis
   - For Pivot Tables, Calculated columns
   - For Dashboard ( Visualisation)

### Data cleaning process
- There are two genders in the organization. However, some employees 
refused to disclose their gender. I entitled them "NonBinary"
- Some employees were without a salary, so I took them out because they were no longer with the company.
- Some departments are indicated as “NULL”, I also proceed by taking them out.
- I checked duplicates, errors, and empty rows.
- I proceeded in splitting the category columns in order to extract relevant information for a good analysis.


#### Explanatory Data Analysis
To conduct a good analysis, I explored the data and asked questions such as :
- What is the Gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
- How does the rating look based on gender
- Identify if there is a gender pay gap regarding the salary structure.
- If there is, I should identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management
- Check if Palmoria meets the requirement of paying employees a minimum of $90,000? 
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
● Also visualize this by regions
