# Capstone project Documentation 
Here is the presentation of my project.
This project stands to be my Capstone project after completing a long training program with DSA.

## Project Topic: Palmoria Group HR Analysis based on Gender

### Project Overview
This data analysis aims to generate insight into gender inequality, if there is one, and identify 
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues, and address them immediately with some recommendations.

### Data source 
The data source used here is Palmoria Group emp data .csv and, Palmoria Group Bonus rules.excel workbook and this is an open-source dataset that can be freely downloaded online on Kaggle or FRED

### Tools Used 
- Ms Excel and POWER BI:
   - For data cleaning
   - For the Explanatory Data Analysis
   - For Pivot Tables, Calculated columns
   - For Dashboard ( Visualisation)

### Data cleaning process
- There are two genders in the organization. However, some employees 
refused to disclose their gender. I entitled them "NonBinary"
- Some employees were without a salary, so I took them out because they were no longer with the company.
- Some departments are indicated as “NULL”, I also proceed by taking them out.
- I checked duplicates, errors, and empty rows.


#### Explanatory Data Analysis
To conduct a good analysis, I explored the data and asked questions such as :
- What is the Gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
- How does the rating look based on gender
- Identify if there is a gender pay gap regarding the salary structure.
- If there is, I should identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management
- Check if Palmoria meets the requirement of paying employees a minimum of $90,000? 
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
- Also visualize this by regions



## Results and Recommendations
According to the data set, In Palmoria Group there is a total of 833 employees distributed in 3 various regions: Abuja, Kaduna, and Lagos.
The two genders are well represented in the company. However, some employees did not disclose their gender, which makes us have: 414 male, 385 female, and 34 NonBinary.
After the global analysis, we can say that at Palmoria Group access to resources and opportunities is not limited by any gender. According to the analysis based on ratings, we can see that males are the ones who have the highest very poor rating, while females are first with the very good rating. It means that you are rewarded according to the work you do. 

As for the salary structure by gender, we noticed that Males come first with $31M, while Females come after with $28M and $3M for NonBinary. The average gender gender pay gap is $1,250. This shows that there is no reflection of gender inequality in the Group. 

As for the new regulation, Palmoria group does not meet the requirement because 567 employees are still under $90,000 monthly. It is an issue to deal with as soon as possible. 
The department where we recommend some changes in terms of salary for the time being are: Research and Development, Human Resources, Product management, Engineering, Sales, Legal services, and Accounting (Kaduna).

Since the Company has not been able to meet the requirement of $90,000 monthly, they are trying their best to implement a bonus system to encourage well-rated employees.
The total amount allocated for the bonus is $1,94M. The total potential amount to be paid is $63,7M annually.


### Recommendations
- Correcting the gender pay gap across departments.
- Allowing everybody to disclose their gender by  creating a peaceful and safe environment.
- Ensuring the regulations are respected by increasing staff salary to $90,000.
- Fostering gender balance and cultivating oneness.
